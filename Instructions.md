Below is a high-level breakdown of how you might implement this pipeline, plus some suggestions for adding the “preprocessing for RAG tuning and vector embedding” steps.

## 1. Main Function Overview

Your main function needs to:

1. Recursively browse through a folder and its subfolders.  
2. For each file:  
   - If **.pdf** or **.docx**: read the file’s text and convert it into an `.xml` file.  
   - If in the “SA Media - External” folder → append to/merge into `External.xml`.  
   - If in the “SA Media - Internal” folder → append to/merge into `Internal.xml`.  
   - If in the “SA Media - Client” folder → append to/merge into `Client.xml`.  
   - If **.mp4** or **.mov**: ignore it entirely.  
3. When creating the `.xml` content, make sure to include the *original file name* as a category or attribute inside each `<record>` or `<entry>` tag.

At the end, you will have `External.xml`, `Internal.xml`, and `Client.xml` as your main outputs.

### Example Directory Structure

```
root_folder/
    SA Media - External/
        file1.pdf
        file2.docx
        ...
    SA Media - Internal/
        file3.pdf
        ...
    SA Media - Client/
        file4.docx
        ...
    OtherFolder/
        file5.pdf   <-- This might not go into the External/Internal/Client .xml
        ...
```

### Parsing and Writing XML

- **Reading `.pdf`**: Typically you can use libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` in Python.
- **Reading `.docx`**: You can use `python-docx`.
- **Writing to `.xml`**: You can either:
  - Use Python’s built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree`, or  
  - Simply build the XML string yourself (though a formal library is usually safer).

### Basic Pseudocode

```python
import os
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader
import docx

def main():
    external_root = ET.Element('Root')
    internal_root = ET.Element('Root')
    client_root = ET.Element('Root')
    
    for subdir, dirs, files in os.walk('path_to_your_root_folder'):
        for filename in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(subdir, filename)
            extension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
            
            # Ignore videos
            if extension in ['.mp4', '.mov']:
                continue
            
            # Process PDFs & DOCXs
            if extension in ['.pdf', '.docx']:
                text = extract_text(file_path, extension)
                
                # Create an <entry> or <record> node
                entry_element = ET.Element('entry')
                entry_element.set('filename', filename)
                entry_element.text = text

                # Decide if it’s External, Internal, or Client
                # (a simple check for folder name in `subdir` path)
                if 'SA Media - External' in subdir:
                    external_root.append(entry_element)
                elif 'SA Media - Internal' in subdir:
                    internal_root.append(entry_element)
                elif 'SA Media - Client' in subdir:
                    client_root.append(entry_element)
                
                # Optionally, if there are “other” folders that matter, handle that here too
                # or if you need them in your main 3 big XMLs, you can define logic accordingly.

    # Write out the final XML files
    tree_external = ET.ElementTree(external_root)
    tree_external.write('External.xml', encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)

    tree_internal = ET.ElementTree(internal_root)
    tree_internal.write('Internal.xml', encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)

    tree_client = ET.ElementTree(client_root)
    tree_client.write('Client.xml', encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)

def extract_text(file_path, extension):
    if extension == '.pdf':
        return extract_text_from_pdf(file_path)
    elif extension == '.docx':
        return extract_text_from_docx(file_path)
    return ""

def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):
    text = []
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        reader = PdfReader(f)
        for page in reader.pages:
            text.append(page.extract_text() or "")
    return "\n".join(text)

def extract_text_from_docx(file_path):
    doc = docx.Document(file_path)
    full_text = [p.text for p in doc.paragraphs]
    return "\n".join(full_text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Note**: This code is just a starting point; you’ll need to adjust it to your environment and needs.

## 2. Post-Main Function Checks

After the main routine is built, you want:

1. **A checking mechanism to ensure files are not read twice**  
   - You can maintain a small database (could be a JSON file) mapping `file_path -> last_modified_timestamp`.  
   - Each time you scan, you compare the current `last_modified_timestamp` of the file to the stored one. If it’s the same, you skip re-reading. If it differs, then you read it again and update the XML.

2. **A checking mechanism to ensure files are not read in the wrong order**  
   - One approach is controlling the order in which `os.walk` processes folders. By default, `os.walk` does it in a certain order, but you can sort the files/folders if you want a guaranteed order (e.g., alphabetical).  
   - Alternatively, you could store a queue of which files should be read first.  
   - “Wrong order” might also mean you only want to read subfolders A, B, C in a certain sequence. If you rely on certain naming patterns, you can enforce that with a manual sort or filter.

3. **A checking mechanism to update the respective .xml content if a file is updated/added/deleted**  
   - This is closely tied to (1). If a file is updated, re-run extraction and update the relevant `<entry>` in the big XML.  
   - If it’s deleted, you need a strategy: maybe remove the entry from the big XML.  
   - If you need real-time or near-real-time updates, you might look into file watchers (e.g., `watchdog` in Python) that automatically pick up file changes in your directories.

In practice, you’ll often store the text in a database or some more sophisticated data structure, rather than constantly rewriting giant XML files. But for a minimal or purely file-based approach, the pattern above works.

## 3. RAG Tuning and Vector Embedding

After your `.xml` files are created, you can feed the text into a pipeline for:

1. **Embedding**  
   - Extract the text from each `<entry>` in `External.xml`, `Internal.xml`, and `Client.xml`.  
   - Use a transformer-based model (e.g., `sentence-transformers`, `OpenAI Embeddings API`, `Hugging Face`, or `Instructor embeddings`) to get vector representations.  
   - Store them in a vector database (e.g., Chroma, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).

2. **Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Once your data is in a vector store, you can query it using a semantic search approach.  
   - The results get appended to your LLM input context so you can do “open-book question answering.”  
   - “RAG tuning” typically means iterating on how you chunk your data, how you retrieve passages, and how you prompt the LLM with that retrieved text.  

### Typical Steps for RAG Preprocessing

1. **Chunk** your text:  
   - Instead of storing entire documents as single embeddings, break them into smaller chunks (e.g., ~500 tokens each). This typically yields better retrieval results.
2. **Embed** each chunk:  
   - `embeddings = embedding_model(chunk_text)`  
   - Store the embedding along with the text chunk and any relevant metadata (filename, source, category).
3. **Load** into a vector store:  
   - `vector_store.upsert({ "id": doc_id, "embedding": embeddings, "metadata": {...}, "text": chunk_text })`
4. **Build** a retriever pipeline that:  
   - Takes a user query → embeds it → similarity search in the vector store → returns top-k chunks → appends them to the user query → sends to the LLM.

## 4. Putting It All Together

Here is how you might structure your overall project:

1. **Preprocessing Script** (the main function you described):
   - Walk folders → read PDF/DOCX → write/append to `External.xml`, `Internal.xml`, `Client.xml`.
   - (Optional) Keep a small JSON “state” to track last_modified_time or checksums to see what’s changed since last run.
2. **Vector Embedding Script**:
   - Read each `.xml` file, chunk the text, embed it, store in a vector database.
   - This script can also watch for updated or newly created `.xml` data.
3. **RAG Inference Pipeline**:
   - On user queries, embed the query → run similarity search in the vector database → retrieve top results → append as context → send to LLM.

From there, you can refine each step as needed.

### Key Points to Keep in Mind

- **File watchers** (if you want an “always-on” solution)  
  Tools like `watchdog` can keep track of new or updated files in real time.  
- **Metadata**  
  Store enough metadata about each chunk so you know which file it came from, when it was last read, etc. This helps with debugging and updates.  
- **Scalability**  
  If the number of documents grows significantly, you might consider moving from flat `.xml` structures to a database.

---

**Conclusion**  
You’re on the right track. Start by focusing on a clean, stable script that handles the folder-walk + `.pdf/.docx → .xml` logic with the checks you need. Once that’s solid, build the embedding and retrieval pipeline for RAG. This modular approach will keep your code more maintainable and make it easier to swap out or upgrade each piece as you move forward.
